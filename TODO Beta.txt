TESTS!

Piece Creation
1. Has at least DISTANCE or FLY. Can't have both. Throw exception if neither or both.
2. Must have a MOVEMENT type.
3. Cannot be placed on the wrong type of board
4. Cannot have multiple pieces of the same type in a GameManager

Movement Checks
1. Check if there's a piece at starting location
2. Check that end location isn't BLOCKED or a piece of same color
3. Check if has FLY attribute. If so, test if the distance is cool. If so test should pass.
4. If not FLY, check DISTANCE integer and check if the distance is even possible for movement (Note: Piece must have at least one of these)
5. Check if BLOCKED space or opponent piece is in the way - for these check UNBLOCK and JUMP booleans respectively
	5.1. If cannot get through a space, either because cannot UNBLOCK, cannot JUMP, or two pieces in a row in the way, if LINEAR return false
	5.2. If not LINEAR, try rerouting
6. If landing on piece of same color, and is true, remove the piece

General Movement Tests
1. Linear of all 3. Can't go too far, can't go in any direction but one
2. Movement- too far? No. Blocked off area? No.
3. Flying- does it just ignore everything? Good
4. Can everything find their destination, if possible, regardless of board type, board size, or movement type

Error Tests
1. On attributes, boolean is on an int attribute such as fly or distance, or vice versa
2. All attributes have an int or boolean
