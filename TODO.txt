Escape Alpha TODO List

Alpha Release Requirements
- Modify BoardBuilder class so it can make a board with the correct coordinates given a file name
  that leads to a configuration file
- Implement BoardInitiliazer so it can instantiate the different board types
- Implement 3 coordinate types w/ static makeCoordinate() method
	- SquareCoordinate
	- HexCoordinate
	- OrthoCoordinate
	
TODO:
The boards use coordinates. Therefore, make coordinates first as they should be able to exist on their own without a board

COORDINATE
1. Implement 3 coordinate types w/ static makeCoordinate() method. All must have overrides of equals() and hashCode().
Also must implement distanceTo(coordinate C)
All Coordinates line up with their CoordinateID types, have x & y ints, and
	1.1 - SquareCoordinate - makeCoordinate() will return simple SquareCoordinate. x & y cannot be < 1
		1.12 - equals() will just be x==x & y==y & type matching
		1.13 - hashCode() simply hash using x & y
		1.14 - distanceTo use simple Chebyshev
		
	1.2 - OrthoSquareCoordinate - Same as square, but Manhattan for distance
		
	1.3 - HexCoordinate - makeCoordinate() will return simple hexCoordinate. x & y can be int
		1.31 - equals() will just be x==x & y==y & type matching
		1.32 - hashCode() simply hash using x & y
		1.33 - distanceTo use cube logic
		1.34 - ID is Hex CoordinateID
	


BOARD
1. All 3 Boards (IN ORDER Square, OrthoSquare, Hex)
	1.1 - Build to a specific size
		1.11 - Account for infinite boards (Hex)
	1.2 - Properly place piece - Check bounds
	1.3 - Properly retrieve pieces - Check bounds
	1.4 - Properly set location type

2. BoardBuilder
	2.1 - Set up so it can differentiate between three different coordinates/squares
