Escape Alpha TODO List

Alpha Release Requirements
- Modify BoardBuilder class so it can make a board with the correct coordinates given a file name
  that leads to a configuration file
- Implement BoardInitiliazer so it can instantiate the different board types
- Implement 3 coordinate types w/ static makeCoordinate() method
	- SquareCoordinate
	- HexCoordinate
	- OrthoCoordinate
	
TODO:
The boards use coordinates. Therefore, make coordinates first as they should be able to exist on their own without a board

COORDINATE
1. Implement 3 coordinate types w/ static makeCoordinate() method. All must have overrides of equals() and hashCode().
Also must implement distanceTo(coordinate C)
All Coordinates line up with their CoordinateID types, have x & y ints, and
	1.1 - SquareCoordinate - makeCoordinate() will return simple SquareCoordinate. x & y cannot be < 1
		1.12 - equals() will just be x==x & y==y & type matching
		1.13 - hashCode() simply hash using x & y
		1.14 - distanceTo use simple Chebyshev
		
	1.2 - OrthoSquareCoordinate - Same as square, but Manhattan for distance
		
	1.3 - HexCoordinate - makeCoordinate() will return simple hexCoordinate. x & y can be infinite, and therefore there will be no range
		1.31 - equals() will just be x==x & y==y & type matching
		1.32 - hashCode() simply hash using x & y
		1.33 - distanceTo use cube logic but in 2D
		1.34 - ID is Hex CoordinateID

BOARD
1. All 3 Boards (IN ORDER Square, OrthoSquare, Hex)
	1.1 - Build to a specific size
		1.11 - Account for infinite boards (Hex)
		1.12 - Can't be negative, square boards can't be 0
	1.2 - Properly place piece - Check bounds
	1.3 - Properly retrieve pieces - Check bounds
	1.4 - Properly set location type
	1.5 - Get location type
	1.6 - Prevent putting a piece at a blocked location

2. BoardBuilder
	2.1 - Set up so it can differentiate between three different coordinates/squares
	2.2 - Streamline it to allow for easy passing
	
3. Create interface (StandardBoard) extended from Board to allow for standard functions to apply to all regular boards
	3.1 - SetLocationType()
	
ADDITIONAL TESTING
1. Can't place pieces outside of the board
2. Can place pieces anywhere on an infinite hex board
3. Hex boards can be finite and infinite
4. Test placement
